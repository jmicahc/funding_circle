It is well known that that the time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is O(nloglogn). We consider how this result is arrived at and how it compares to less optimal algorithms, such as the standard trial division as well as the optimized trial division algorithm that are often mistaken for the true Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
